This directory contains a plugin for DokuWiki (http://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki)

The plugin is highly experimental, and only supports a few features. 

Working:
  * directory listings
  * reading and editing existing pages

Todo:
  * Use the TemporaryFileFilter (integration with the dokuwiki cache)
  * Add locking (should also integrate with the dokuwiki cache)
  * Authentication integration
  * Creating new pages
  * Retrieving more info on pages, such as filesize and last modification date
  * Admin panel integration

Installation:
  * Drop dav.php into the main dokuwiki directory
  * Drop the lib/Sabre directory in the dokuwiki lib/ directory
  * Use http://yourdokuwikinstallation/dav.php/ as an endpoint.

Using windows WebDAV client:
  It should be noted that windows cannot (yet) work with this endpoint, for reasons described at:
  http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/wiki/Windows#Implementor_notes

Editing:
  Finder and DavFSv2 (in default configuration) require WebDAV locking support in order to do edits.
  While this is not the case, it is only possible to read pages.

  For OS/X Cyberduck is recommended to do edits.
