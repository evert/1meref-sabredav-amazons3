0.5-alpha (2009-01-14)
	* Added: Added a very simple example for implementing a mapping to PHP
	  file streams. This should allow easy implementation of for example a
	  WebDAV to FTP proxy.
	* Added: HTTP Basic Authentication helper class.
	* Added: Sabre_HTTP_Reponse class. This centralizes HTTP operations and
	  will be a start towards the creating of a testing framework.
	* Updated: Backwards compatibility break: all require_once() statements
	  are removed
	  from all the files. It is now recommended to use autoloading of 
	  classes, or just including lib/Sabre.includes.php. This fix was made
	  to allow easier integration into applications not using this standard
	  inclusion model.
	* Updated: Better in-file documentation.
	* Updated: Sabre_DAV_Tree can now work with Sabre_DAV_LockManager.
	* Updated: Fixes a shared-lock bug.
	* Updated: Removed ?> from the bottom of each php file.
	* Updated: Split up some operations from Sabre_DAV_Server to
	  Sabre_HTTP_Response.
	* Fixed: examples are now actually included in the pear package.

	* Added: Phing build scripts 
	* Added: PEAR package 
	* Fixed: MOVE bug identied using finder.
