0.7-alpha (2009-??-??)
	* Added: System to return complex properties from PROPFIND
	* Added: support for {DAV:}supportedlock
	* Added: 1 unittest
	* Fixed: bug related to parsing proppatch and propfind requests. Didn't
	show up in most clients, but it needed fixing regardless.
	* Fixed: auth-int is now properly supported within HTTP Digest.

0.6-alpha (2009-02-16)
	* Added: Now uses streams for files, instead of strings.
	  This means it won't require to hold entire files in memory, which can be
	  an issue if you're dealing with big files. Note that this breaks 
	  compatibility for put() and createFile methods.
	* Added: HTTP Digest Authentication helper class.
	* Added: Support for HTTP Range header
	* Added: Support for ETags within If: headers
	* Added: The API can now return ETags and override the default Content-Type
	* Added: starting with basic framework for unittesting, using PHPUnit.
	* Added: 49 unittests.
	* Added: Abstraction for the HTTP request.
	* Updated: Using Clark Notation for tags in properties. This means tags
	are serialized as {namespace}tagName instead of namespace#tagName
	* Fixed: HTTP_BasicAuth class now works as expected.
	* Fixed: DAV_Server uses / for a default baseUrl.
	* Fixed: Last modification date is no longer ignored in PROPFIND.
	* Fixed: PROPFIND now sends back information about the requestUri even
	  when "Depth: 1" is specified.

0.5-alpha (2009-01-14)
	* Added: Added a very simple example for implementing a mapping to PHP
	  file streams. This should allow easy implementation of for example a
	  WebDAV to FTP proxy.
	* Added: HTTP Basic Authentication helper class.
	* Added: Sabre_HTTP_Reponse class. This centralizes HTTP operations and
	  will be a start towards the creating of a testing framework.
	* Updated: Backwards compatibility break: all require_once() statements
	  are removed
	  from all the files. It is now recommended to use autoloading of 
	  classes, or just including lib/Sabre.includes.php. This fix was made
	  to allow easier integration into applications not using this standard
	  inclusion model.
	* Updated: Better in-file documentation.
	* Updated: Sabre_DAV_Tree can now work with Sabre_DAV_LockManager.
	* Updated: Fixes a shared-lock bug.
	* Updated: Removed ?> from the bottom of each php file.
	* Updated: Split up some operations from Sabre_DAV_Server to
	  Sabre_HTTP_Response.
	* Fixed: examples are now actually included in the pear package.

0.4-alpha (2008-11-05)
	* Passes all litmus tests!
	* Added: more examples
	* Added: Custom property support
	* Added: Shared lock support
	* Added: Depth support to locks
	* Added: Locking on unmapped urls (non-existant nodes)
	* Fixed: Advertising as WebDAV class 3 support

0.3-alpha (2008-06-29) 
	* Fully working in MS Windows clients.
	* Added: temporary file filter: support for smultron files.
	* Added: Phing build scripts 
	* Added: PEAR package 
	* Fixed: MOVE bug identied using finder.
	* Fixed: Using gzuncompress instead of gzdecode in the temporary file
	  filter. This seems more common.

0.2-alpha (2008-05-27) 
	* Somewhat working in Windows clients 
	* Added: Working PROPPATCH method (doesn't support custom properties yet)
	* Added: Temporary filename handling system 
	* Added: Sabre_DAV_IQuota to return quota information
	* Added: PROPFIND now reads the request body and only supplies the
	  requested properties

0.1-alpha (2008-04-04)
	* First release!
	* Passes litmus: basic, http and copymove test.
	* Fully working in Finder and DavFSv2
