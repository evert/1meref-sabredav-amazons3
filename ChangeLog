0.9-alpha (????-??-??)
	* Changed: Major refactoring, removed most of the logic from the Tree
	  objects. The Server class now directly works with the INode, IFile
	  and IDirectory objects. If you created your own Tree objects,
	  this will most likely break in this release.
	* Changed: Moved all the Locking logic from the Tree and Server classes
	  into a separate plugin.
	* Added: User authentication addon. 
	* Added: htdigest Authentcation backend
	* Added: Comes with an autoloader script. This can be used instead of
	  the includer script, and is preferered by some people.
	* Added: AWS Authentication class.
	* Added: simpleserversetup.py script. This will quickly get a fileserver
	  up and running.
	* Added: When subscribing to events, it is now possible to supply a
	  priority. This is for example needed to ensure that the Authentication
	  Plugin is used before any other Plugin. 
	* Fixed: Exclusive locks could in some case be picked up as shared locks 

0.8-alpha (2009-05-30)
	* Changed: Renamed all exceptions! This is a compatibility break. Every
	  Exception now follows Sabre_DAV_Exception_FileNotFound convention
	  instead of Sabre_DAV_FileNotFoundException.
	* Added: Browser plugin now allows uploading and creating directories
	  straight from the browser.
	* Added: 12 more unittests
	* Fixed: Locking bug, which became prevalent on Windows Vista.
	* Fixed: Netdrive support
	* Fixed: TemporaryFileFilter filtered out too many files. Fixed some
	  of the regexes.
	* Fixed: Added README and ChangeLog to package

0.7-alpha (2009-03-29)
	* Added: System to return complex properties from PROPFIND.
	* Added: support for {DAV:}supportedlock.
	* Added: support for {DAV:}lockdiscovery.
	* Added: 6 new tests.
	* Added: New plugin system.
	* Added: Simple HTML directory plugin, for browser access.
	* Added: Server class now sends back standard pre-condition error xml
	bodies. This was new since RFC4918.
	* Added: Sabre_DAV_Tree_Aggregrate, which can 'host' multiple Tree objects
	into one.
	* Added: simple basis for HTTP REPORT method. This method is not used yet,
	but can be used by plugins to add reports.
	* Changed: ->getSize is only called for files, no longer for collections.
	r303
	* Changed: Sabre_DAV_FilterTree is now Sabre_DAV_Tree_Filter
	* Changed: Sabre_DAV_TemporaryFileFilter is now called
	Sabre_DAV_Tree_TemporaryFileFilter.
	* Changed: removed functions (get(/set)HTTPRequest(/Response)) from Server
	class, and using a public property instead.
	* Fixed: bug related to parsing proppatch and propfind requests. Didn't
	show up in most clients, but it needed fixing regardless. (r255)
	* Fixed: auth-int is now properly supported within HTTP Digest.
	* Fixed: Using application/xml for a mimetype vs. text/xml as per RFC4918
	sec 8.2.
	* Fixed: TemporaryFileFilter now lets through GET's if they actually
	exist on the backend. (r274)
	* FIxed: Some methods didn't get passed through in the FilterTree (r283).
	* Fixed: LockManager is now slightly more complex, Tree classes slightly
	less. (r287)

0.6-alpha (2009-02-16)
	* Added: Now uses streams for files, instead of strings.
	  This means it won't require to hold entire files in memory, which can be
	  an issue if you're dealing with big files. Note that this breaks 
	  compatibility for put() and createFile methods.
	* Added: HTTP Digest Authentication helper class.
	* Added: Support for HTTP Range header
	* Added: Support for ETags within If: headers
	* Added: The API can now return ETags and override the default Content-Type
	* Added: starting with basic framework for unittesting, using PHPUnit.
	* Added: 49 unittests.
	* Added: Abstraction for the HTTP request.
	* Updated: Using Clark Notation for tags in properties. This means tags
	are serialized as {namespace}tagName instead of namespace#tagName
	* Fixed: HTTP_BasicAuth class now works as expected.
	* Fixed: DAV_Server uses / for a default baseUrl.
	* Fixed: Last modification date is no longer ignored in PROPFIND.
	* Fixed: PROPFIND now sends back information about the requestUri even
	  when "Depth: 1" is specified.

0.5-alpha (2009-01-14)
	* Added: Added a very simple example for implementing a mapping to PHP
	  file streams. This should allow easy implementation of for example a
	  WebDAV to FTP proxy.
	* Added: HTTP Basic Authentication helper class.
	* Added: Sabre_HTTP_Reponse class. This centralizes HTTP operations and
	  will be a start towards the creating of a testing framework.
	* Updated: Backwards compatibility break: all require_once() statements
	  are removed
	  from all the files. It is now recommended to use autoloading of 
	  classes, or just including lib/Sabre.includes.php. This fix was made
	  to allow easier integration into applications not using this standard
	  inclusion model.
	* Updated: Better in-file documentation.
	* Updated: Sabre_DAV_Tree can now work with Sabre_DAV_LockManager.
	* Updated: Fixes a shared-lock bug.
	* Updated: Removed ?> from the bottom of each php file.
	* Updated: Split up some operations from Sabre_DAV_Server to
	  Sabre_HTTP_Response.
	* Fixed: examples are now actually included in the pear package.

	* Added: Phing build scripts 
	* Added: PEAR package 
	* Fixed: MOVE bug identied using finder.

	* Added: Working PROPPATCH method (doesn't support custom properties yet)
	* Added: Temporary filename handling system
